-------------------------------------------------- ZMap Add-Ons -------------------------------------------------

1.8.3   (Add-Ons) Added support for Xenon Defect gamestart.


-------------------------------------------------- Original ZMap ------------------------------------------------

1.8.2	Fixed bug where it would say the custom music folder didn't exist.
1.8.1	Added ability to change music for a specific sector using the sector editor.
1.8.0	Added custom music folder capability
1.7.8	Fixed issue with the ship randomizer raising laser generator above 2 Million.  This is a fixed X3 limit which if exceeded, will cause lasers to not fire at all.
1.7.7	Added final check to ensure there is at least 1 Unknown Enclave.  Used for Renegades plot.
1.7.6	Fixed issue where it would not activate a map if it already showed it as activated.
1.7.5	Fixed version number
		Added reminder text on form field for setting the root and saved folder locations.
		Changed defaults to show terran memory sectors and sector statistics.
1.7.4	Fixed lockup condition if you choose Chaotic Start at the same time as Clustered Voids.
1.7.3	Enhanced Ship & Weapons randomizer to allow user to select either 20% or 30% for maximum change amount.
		Also, Ship adjustment now affects number of shields as well: Provided the base number of shields is > 4, randomization can add or subtract 1 shield.
1.7.2	For ship and weapons stats randomization feature, this will now create the necessary "/addon/types" folder, which doesn't exist by default in a fresh install.
1.7.1   Changed to Relase build.  Had debug build out in 1.7.  Updated TBullets.txt and TShips.txt which are used for when/if you override bullet or ship stats.
1.7		. Added ability to randomize certain ship and weapons stats.  
		There is a new speed launch icon at the top of the app that launches this editor.  
		It will impose a random variation on stats (show below) depending on what option you choose in the screen.
		This provides your new games with some variation so what used to be the worst ship or weapon may very well be the
		best choice in a new game, or visa versa.
		Note, this does so by saving a modified TBullets.txt and/or TShips.txt file into your Mayhem's "/addon/types" folder, which
		serves to override the game defaults.
		Should you want to eliminate any changes this makes, simply delete these 2 files from that folder.

		Modifier:
		Between 0.80 and 1.20, calculated uniquely for each Bullet or Ship and then applied identically to all noted stats in that Bullet or Ship.

		TBullets modifications:
		Hull damage, Shield damage, OOS hull damage, OOS shield damage (all 4 use the same modifier)
		Lifetime (laser range)

		TShips modifications
		Cargo min, Cargo max
		Production rel. value (NPC), Production rel. val (player)
		Yaw, Pitch, Roll
		Speed (base) + Max speed + Acceleration
		Hull strength
		Power (shield recharge)

1.6.1	. Fixed but where you couldn't save map if terran dejure setting was added.
1.6		. Added Terrans as a normal race, equal to the others.
1.5  	. Fixed maelstrom setting.
		. Updated Russian translations
		. You can now edit the sunlight level in a system.
		. Edit music for a system?
1.4		. You can now add or remove Gates from the sector Editor!
		. Added Peaceful and Chaotic Xenon Starts.
		. Added a slight offset to the displayed gate lines on the main galaxy map in conditions where the gate jumps to a sector more than 1 jump away.
			In the previous map generator, gate connected systems were Forced to exist next to each other, although the game can likely handle longer distances (see note below).
			However, the game has a hard and severe restriction to the length of a display line for a gate on the galaxy map, so there's no way to make it stretch over many gate distances.  Therefore,
			a slight "offset" in placement was given to such gates so you can visually tell that it's a special gate that goes more than 1 jump.
			Note: It has been observed that the A.I. sends many ships through these long gates.  Traders, fleets etc.  So the game is clearly able to handle traversing them.
			What is unknown at this time, is whether the calculated jump distances for such 'long' gates are correctly observed for all distance calculations (I.E. how far your agents can travel, etc.).
			I'm pretty sure it's fine, as the gates are what it 'should' be using for pathing calculations, but I've not proven it yet.

1.3		Added localization
		Fixed Several bugs mentioned on the forums.
		You can now set the Maelstrom Portal location in a Xenon sector.  This will only be utilized in a future version of Zero Hour.

1.2		Fixed Extra System stats not working on new map generation.
		Fixed loading old galaxy maps.  U.I. settings from old maps are not retained.
		Fixed generating nvidium asteroids when it should only be ore and silicon.
		Added EmptySpacePercent|	 to settings file.  You can set this from 16-50% to change the amount of void/empty space generated.  Doing so will negate the Shattered Galaxy option entirely.
		Added XenonPercent|		to settings file.  Default is 3% if left blank.  You can adjust this up to 10.


1.1		Initial release.



			ZMap			ZMap			ZMap			ZMap

Important Warning for saved games:
. When run for the very first time, ZMap will not detect which of your maps is the "current" map that X3 is actively set to use.  It doesn't know which one is "current".
	As a result, when choosing a different map to play (I.E. Activating it), it will NOT backup your savegame files first, so back them up if you want them!
	This occurs only once.  After that, ZMap can properly track which game is the current one.  Saved game handling is automatic in ZMap for all maps created.  
	This means that when you activate a new map, the saved games from your old map are backed up first.


Goals

The primary design goals for ZMap are as follows:
	1. Improve on the quality and flexibility of map generation 
	2. Provide more options to enhance a given map
	3. Provide the ability to edit system stats

The new design focuses on reducing randomize placement of systems and gates in an attempt to create what might seem more natural for a race's expansion into space.
It also focuses on intelligently reducing the number of interconnected gates with the goal to create far more strategically oriented maps.
As you experiment with ZMap and see how it goes about creating clusters of races and void areas, along with the various ways gates 
interconnect them, I hope you like what you see.  There are a number of new features that will improve your experience, and a number
of features yet to come.

Features
.  Larger, more readable presentation of the map.
.  System stats such as Max Population and Station support level are displayed on the map (this can be turned off).
.  Gates are displayed on the map.
.  You can choose your starting system.  Double-click a system and check the option.
.  You can independently re-generate gates for a map.  Thus, you generate the sector map you like, and then you can 
	regenerate the gate layout until you get the type of paths you like.  A lot of work has been put into creating interesting gate layouts
	and I hope you won't be doing much regeneration, but if you do, why be forced to re-create the entire map if you don't like how gates are layed out.  
	Now you can just click a button and new lines start spewing forth in all their glory.
.  You can independently re-generate all system attributes.  No more need to regenerate the entire map if you don't like how the system stats ended up.
.  You can edit the attributes of any system by double clicking on it.
.  Added the new Border Gate Density setting.
	In general, the generator attempts to create a couple large "clusters" of race-specific systems, both  created in one single quadrant
	(upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right, or middle).  An additional small cluster for the race is created in another
	random sector.  This models, in my opinion, a more realistic starting expansion layout for a race.  
	The Border Gate Density setting further enhances this by removing an extra percentage of gates that border between one race's clusters
	and another race's clusters.  You tend to end up with more gates interconnecting your own space, and less gates interconnecting with
	systems of other races, and this is adjustable.  I believe this provides a more strategic map to play and hope you enjoy it.
.  Added the Clustered Voids setting.
	Void/Empty areas can be randomly sprinkled on the map, but in some cases you get a nicer result by allowing the engine
	to try to create those void systems in clusters.  Void systems are created first, and race systems are then created in the remaining areas.
.  Galaxy size has been simplified to 3 settings, but an extra Map Type option has been added to also provide a Rectangular map as opposed to square.
.  System backgrounds and System music duplication across systems has been mostly eliminated.  These resource lists are first fully used
	during generation until there are no more left, and only then are random one's chosen from the source lists.
.  You can new choose the "All" option for system music, which will use all of the music files found in your Mayhem 3's Soundtrack folder.  Be aware, that while this
	is cool, it can lead to maps generated that are specific to your installation only and not sharable with others who may not have those music files.
	Using this feature, you could conceivably use any compatible mp3 files you wish for your systems.  ACDC anyone?
.  Terran Memory systems can be hilighted in the map (this can be turned off).
.  You can load a map created by the original older map generator and then edit and save that changed map.  


Notes:
	. If Limited Enclaves is turned off, the program will attempt to remove a portion of existing gates where such an action would leave a single gated system (an Enclave).
	. Generator does not currently use \mayhem_data\fog_presets.json to determine fog levels.  Levels used are similar, but hard-coded for now.
	. Generator does not currently use \mayhem_data\gamestart_ships.json.  Previously, you could conceivably alter your starting ship class by altering this file when generating a map. For now, this is hard-coded to an M4 class ship.
	. The number of any particular type of company generated in the galaxy varied greatly.  Some could be as low as 1% of the systems while others as high as 5%.  This is now a bit more even distribution.
	. When loading an old map created by the old generator, the U.I. settings that were used originally used to create that map are not loaded by ZMap.  This is true also for any startup locations, or Fog settings set in that old map.
	  You can still load it, edit it however you want, set startup locations and then save it.
