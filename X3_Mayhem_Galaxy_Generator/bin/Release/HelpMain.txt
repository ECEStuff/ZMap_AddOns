1. FIRST, the program should have asked you for your Mayhem 3 folders.  Please ensure these are correct.
	If they are not set and shown correctly at the top left of your main screen, click on the fields to Set them.

	Normally, these look like this, but you'll need to ensure they match YOUR installation:
	Mayhem 3 Root Folder		-	C:\Mayhem\
	Mayhem 3 Save Game Folder	-	C:\Users\mylogin\Documents\Egosoft\X3AP\save\

2. SECOND, click the "Generate Systems" Button.
	This generates a map according to all the settings you have shown on this screen.
	If you don't like what it generated, change some settings and click it again and again.
	You can click icons at the top of the form to turn ON/OFF the display of system Statistics and Terran Memory sectors.

3. If you like the Map as it is, but don't like the ways the Gates are connecting each sector,
	click "Re-Generate Gates" over and over until you do like it.  Alternately, you can
	Double-Click on a system in the map, and from there, you can add or remove gates connected to it.

4. If you like everything, but don't like the system Statistics generated you can randomize them all again
	without changing the map layout by clicking the "Re-Generate Stats" button.  Alternately, you can
	double click on a system in the map and change most of the system stats.

5. Finally, once you like everything, click the "Save/Load Galaxy" button.
	Here, you should do 2 things:
	1. SAVE your map. Give it a name and save it.
	2. Make that map ACTIVE.  This actually copies the map files to your working X3 game folder and now a new game uses it!



Ships and Weapons Editor
-------------------------
Located in the toolbar, there is a launch icon for the Ships and Weapons Editor.
The purpose of this editor is NOT to allow editing of individual ships or weapons, as you can already do that through the use
of the "X3 Editor 2".


1. This editor will allow you to globally randomize Weapons stats, providing some unique variation for each game you play.
	Key weapon stats are adjusted by +/- 20% and uniquely computed for EACH weapon.  Some may go up and others down.
2. The editor will also allow you to randomize or adjust up/down key ship statistics based on a Race.  
	This will allow you to pick any given race and apply either a random adjustment to all their ships, or you can
	lower or raise their ship capabilities.  If you feel the Paranid are too strong, simply select their race
	from the drop-down and select "lower all ship status for Race" and click "Execute" !
3. The Editor also allows you to restore the game defaults.

Note:  If something doesn't appear to be working, check your /addon/types/ folder and ensure there are no TShips.pck or TBullets.pck files there. 
	If you find any, either delete or rename them to .temp or something else.

This editor works by allowing you to graphically edit the Default TShips.txt and TBullets.txt files. (These were extracted from Mayhem 3's 10.cat file.)
Once these files are adjusted by this editor, it writes them out to the /addon/types/ folder in your Mayhem 3 install folder, where
these settings will automatically Override the default values found in the 10.cat file in the game.  You can certainly modify these values
by hand, but they are a bit hard to parse and read.  The editor does this for you, and also allows the important values to be randomized globally
or by Race.

	Stats Modified
	---------------
	All stats listed here are modified by a random value between -20% and +20% computed uniquely for EACH Weapon or Ship.
	If you choose to "Raise" ship stats for a race, each ship in that race will receive a change of +10% to +20% computed randomly for EACH ship in that race.  
	If you choose to "Lower" ship stats for a race, each ship in that race will receive a change of -10% to -20% computed randomly for EACH ship in that race. 

	1. Weapons Stats:	
		. Hull Damage (both in/out of system)
		. Shield Damage (both in/out of system)
		. Lifetime (laser range)
	2. Ship Stats:
		. Cargo min, Cargo max
		. Production rel. value (NPC), Production rel. val (player)
